          <p>"It seems to me that Brawl was a great title for gamers new to the franchise, but for Smash veterans it was nothing to write home about. (…) One thing I have to keep in mind as a developer is that it's not enough to make a game that satisfies our core fans. We have to reach and attract new players. Finding the sweet spot is always difficult.”</p>
